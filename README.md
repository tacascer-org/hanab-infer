This is the monorepo for the Hanab infer project.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to provide help to players of the board
game [Hanabi](https://rnrgames.com/hanabi).

The help is provided in the form of a classifier that interprets the events in
the game and advises the player on what knowledge they should infer from those
events.
